                    The migration data was compiled by the IRS using tax returns from each year, based on social security numbers.  The "returns" column shows you the number of returns that have moved from one state to another between tax years - for example, if someone filed his or her taxes in Colorado in 1993, and, using the same social security number, filed in California in 1994, that tax return would be counted as a move from Colorado to California for 1993 to 94. <br> <br> Because individual returns include dependent children, and married couples typically file one single joint return, this number does not reflect total population movement, which is more accurately represented by the "exemptions" column.  The number of exemptions on a tax return corresponds with the number of people the return is for; for example, a return for a married couple with two children would have four exemptions.  Therefore, this number is closely correlated with the movement of individual persons. <br> <br> Finally, "AGI" stands for "Adjusted Gross Income" - this is the income reported on the tax return that is the baseline for most tax calculations, and is usually the same as total income.  The AGI figures are in thousands of dollars, so a figure of $1,200 between two states would mean that migrants that year had a collective income of $1,200,000. </a>

                   No, except for the option to adjust AGI figures for inflation. The numbers came straight from the IRS. In those rare instances in which the IRS, for disclosure purposes, did not include a state-to-state figure, we assumed a value of zero.

                   Every day, the Tax Foundation uses data from governmental agencies like the Census Bureau, IRS, and others to better inform citizens. Given our specialty and familiarity with IRS data combined with the amount of requests that we receive for information pertaining to migration, we felt it was worth creating this tool as part of our MyTaxBurden.org interactive data project.

                    No. Taxes are one of hundreds of factors that go into a person's decision to move. Others include age, technology, job prospects and the quality/quantity of government services provided. If one looks anecdotally at the data, he/she will see that people move from high-tax states to low-tax states and vice versa. A true study that sought to quantify the importance of taxes for locational decisions would need to account for as many other factors as possible, in addition to possible serial correlation issues between variables, especially taxes.
